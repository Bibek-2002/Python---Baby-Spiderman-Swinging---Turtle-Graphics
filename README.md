# Baby Spiderman Swinging

Welcome to the Baby Spiderman Swinging project! This repository contains a Python script that leverages the Turtle graphics library to draw a charming, cartoonish depiction of baby Spiderman in mid-swing. This playful rendition captures the essence of Spiderman with a whimsical touch appropriate for his "baby" form.

## Project Overview

This script illustrates a simplified baby version of Spiderman, complete with his iconic costume colors and web-swinging action. Using Python's built-in Turtle module, the script draws:
- A large, round head to highlight the youthful version of Spiderman.
- Distinctive, large eyes on the mask.
- A compact body swinging from a web.
- Simple limbs positioned to mimic swinging motion.
- Color fills in classic red and blue to bring the character to life on your screen.

## Prerequisites

Before you run this script, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. Python 3.x is recommended. The Turtle graphics library is part of the standard Python library, so no additional installations are required.
